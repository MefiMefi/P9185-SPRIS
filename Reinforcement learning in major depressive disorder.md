# Reinforcement learning in major depressive disorder

What is a good model for characterizing decision making and reward

How MDD affect those

## Study and Data

- Data types
  - demographical, clinical
  - neuroimaging
  - behavioral
    - probabilistic reward task: measures the subject's ability to modify behavior in response to rewards
    - Participant's goal: learn from PRT system
      - Reward generating mechanism is unknown for participants
      - Win a dollar with probability, the probability of receiving dollars for each answer is not the same
    - subject tend to prioritize states with higher rewards
    - MDD subjects perform worse in PRT than Control
- Experimental Design
  - Case/Control

## Classical RL Models

- S
- A
- R
- Q-learning model

## Semiparametric RL Models

## RL-HMM Framework
