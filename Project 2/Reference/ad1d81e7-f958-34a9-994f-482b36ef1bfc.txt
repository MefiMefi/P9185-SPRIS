 abstract = {Marginal generalized linear models are now frequently used for the analysis of longitudinal data. Semiparametric inference for marginal models was introduced by Liang and Zeger (1986, Biometrics 73, 13-22). This article develops a general parametric class of serial dependence models that permits likelihood-based marginal regression analysis of binary response data. The methods naturally extend the first-order Markov models of Azzalini (1994, Biometrika 81, 767-775) and prove computationally feasible for long series.},
